# Interactive Plotting with Jupyter

To use these Jupyter notebooks, you'll need Jupyter. The easiest way  to use
Jupyter is with anaconda, which comes with a number of scientific packages
automatically. Next, you'll need to install plotly an  cufflinks. At a command
line, type the following:

    conda install plotly
    pip install cufflinks

Alternatively, you could try creating a new environment from the the
environment yml file (cmw2018.yml)
